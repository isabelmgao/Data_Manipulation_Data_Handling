# Data_Manipulation_Data_Handling
Manipulating Data from the World Bank's summary dataset



The purpose of this assignment was to become more familiar with Python’s
programming constructs, data-handling methods and libraries, and (b) to get you started doing
some basic manipulation of real data.
This assignment used a summary dataset from the World Bank, containing 18 ‘indicators’
(statistics) from over 200 countries, collected for each year in the period 2000-2010. (This is a
subset of a larger dataset with 331 indicators spanning 1960-present: more information about
each indicator and those not included here can be found at: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator )
